<p>The live results page has a <span class="button-name">Liquidate</span> button that acts as a "kill switch" to sell all of the non-Equity holdings in your portfolio at the current market price using market orders and then stop the algorithm. For instance, if your algorithm has a bug in it that caused it to purchase a lot of securities that you didn't want, you can liquidate your portfolio instead of placing many manual trades. </p>

<p>Follow these steps to liquidate your positions:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Open your algorithm's <a href="/docs/v2/our-platform/live-trading/results#02-View-Live-Results">live results page</a>.</li>
    <li>Click <span class='button-name'>Liquidate</span>.</li>
    <li>Click <span class='button-name'>Liquidate</span> again.</li>
</ol>
