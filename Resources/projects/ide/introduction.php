  The <?=$cloudPlatform ? "web" : "VS Code"?> Integrated Development Environment (IDE) lets you work on research notebooks and develop algorithms for backtesting and live trading. When you <a href='<?=$openProjectLink?>'>open a project</a>, the IDE automatically displays.  You can access your trading algorithms from anywhere in the world with just an internet connection and a browser. <?=$localPlatformOrCli ?
