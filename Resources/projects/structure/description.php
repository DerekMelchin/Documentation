<p>You can give a project a description to provide a high-level overview of the project and its functionality. Descriptions make it easier to return to old projects and understand what is going on at a high level without having to look at the code. The project description is also displayed at the top of <?=$localPlatform ? "backtest reports" : "<a href='/docs/v2/cloud-platform/backtesting/report'>backtest reports</a>"?>, which you can create after your backtest completes.</p>
