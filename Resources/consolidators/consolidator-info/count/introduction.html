<p>Count consolidators aggregate data based on a number of bars or ticks. This type of consolidator aggregates <span class="latex-variable">n</span> samples together, regardless of the time period the samples cover. Managing count consolidators is similiar to managing <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/consolidating-data/consolidator-types/time-period-consolidators'>time period consolidators</a>, except you create count consolidators with an integer argument instead of a time-based argument.</p>
