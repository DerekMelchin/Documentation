<p>LEAN currently loads the capital from all the account Ids under your IB user name. For example, if you have an IB user with a trading account that contains $10 USD and a tax-free savings account (TFSA) that contains $0 USD, when you deploy an algorithm with the trading account Id or TFSA account Id, the <a href='/docs/v2/our-platform/live-trading/results#07-Holdings'>Holdings tab in the live results page</a> shows $10 USD.
