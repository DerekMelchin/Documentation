<p>This page describes all of the pre-built settlement models in LEAN. For more brokerage-specific settlement models, see the <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/reality-modeling/brokerages/supported-models">brokerage model documentation</a>. If none of these models perform exactly how you want, create a <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/reality-modeling/settlement/key-concepts#04-Model-Structure">custom settlement model</a>.</p>
