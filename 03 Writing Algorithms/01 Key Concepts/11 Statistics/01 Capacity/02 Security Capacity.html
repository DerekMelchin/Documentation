<p>The first step to determine the capacity of the strategy is to compute the capacity of each security the strategy trades.</p>

<h4>Market Capacity Dollar Volume</h4>

<p>Following each order fill, LEAN monitors and records the dollar-volume for a series of bars. To get an estimate of the available capacity, we combine many second and minute trade bars together. For hourly or daily data resolutions, we only use one bar.</p>

<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="csharp">_marketCapacityDollarVolume += bar.Close * _fastTradingVolumeDiscountFactor * bar.Volume * conversionRate * Security.SymbolProperties.ContractMultiplier;</pre>
</div>

<h5>Crypto Volume</h5>

<p>Crypto trade volume is light, but there is significant capacity even at the very top of the order book. The estimated volume of Crypto is based on the average size on the bid and ask.</p>

<h5>Forex and CFD Volume</h5>

<p>Forex and CFD assets do not have a trade volume or quote size information so they were approximated as deeply liquid assets with approximately $25,000,000 depth per minute.</p>


<h5>Volume Accumulation Period</h5>

<p>The number of bars we use to calculate the market volume estimate depends on the asset liquidity. The following table shows the formulas LEAN uses to determine how long of a period the market capacity dollar volume is accumulated for after each order fill, as a function of the security resolution. The $AvgDollarVolume$ in the table represents the average dollar volume per minute for the security you're trading. Notice that for the edge case where the average dollar volume is zero, the calculations use 10 minutes of data.</p>


<table class="qc-table table">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Resolution</th>

<p>Only a fraction of the market capacity dollar volume is available to be taken by a strategyâ€™s orders because there are other market participants. The data resolution of the security determines how much of the market capacity dollar volume is available for the strategy to consume. The following table shows what percentage of the market capacity dollar volume is available for each of the data resolutions:</p>

<h4>Fast Trading Volume Discount Factor</h4>

<p>To accommodate high-frequency trading strategies, the <code>_fastTradingVolumeDiscountFactor</code> variable scales down the market capacity dollar volume of the security proportional to the number of trades that it places per day for the security. The more frequently the strategy trades a security, the lower the capacity of the security goes since it becomes harder to get into a larger position without incurring significant market impact. The formula that LEAN uses to discount the capacity of the securities that the algorithm trades intraday is</p>

\[ d_i = \left\{
  \begin{array}{ c l }
    1,& \text{if } i = 1\\
    \min(1, \max(0.2, d_{i-1} * \frac{m}{390})), & \text{if } i > 1
  \end{array}
\right. \]

<p>where \( d_i\in{[0.2, 1]} \) is the fast trading volume discount factor after order \(i\) and \(m\) is the number of minutes since order \( i-1 \) was filled. We divide \( m \) by 390 because there are \( 390 = 6.5 * 60 \) minutes of trading in a regular Equity trading day.</p>


<h4>Sale Volume</h4>

<p>In addition to the market capacity dollar volume, for each security the strategy trades, LEAN also accumulates the weekly sale volume of the order fills. The sale volume scales down the weekly snapshot capacity. </p>

<div class="section-example-container">
<pre class="csharp">SaleVolume += orderEvent.FillPrice * orderEvent.AbsoluteFillQuantity * Security.SymbolProperties.ContractMultiplier;</pre>
</div>
