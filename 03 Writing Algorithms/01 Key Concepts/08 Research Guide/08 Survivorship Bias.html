<p>Survivorship bias occurs when you test a strategy using only the securities that have survived to the end of the testing period and omit securities that have been delisted. If you use the current constituents of an index and backtest over the past, you'll most likely outperform the index because many of the underperformers have dropped out of the index over time and outperformers have been added to the index. In this case, the current constituent universe would consist of only outperformers. This technique is a form of look-ahead bias because if you were trading the strategy in real-time throughout the backtest period, you would not know the current index constituents until today.</p>

<p>If you analyze a dataset that has survivorship bias, you can discover results that are opposite of the true results. For example, Wang et al. (2014) analyze the low volatility factor using two universes. The first universe was the current S&amp;P 500 constituents and the second universe was the point-in-time constituents. When they used the point-in-time constituents, the low volatility quintile outperformed the high volatility quintile. However, when they used the current constituents, the high volatility quintile significantly outperformed the low volatility quintile. </p>

<p>To avoid issues with survivorship bias, trade a <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/universes/key-concepts">dynamic universe of assets</a> and use the datasets in the <a href="/datasets">Dataset Market</a>. We thoroughly vet the datasets we add to the market to ensure they're free of survivorship bias. </p>
