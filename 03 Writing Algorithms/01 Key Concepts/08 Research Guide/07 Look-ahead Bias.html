<p>Look-ahead bias occurs when you use information from the future to inform decisions in the present. An example of look-ahead bias is using financial statement data to make trading decisions at the end of the reporting period instead of when the financial statement data was released. Another example is using updated financial statement data before the updated figures were actually available. Wang et al. (2014) show that using the date of when the period ends instead of when the data is actually available can increase the performance of the earnings yield factor by 60%.</p>

<p>Another culprit of look-ahead bias is adjusted price data. Splits and reverse splits can improve liquidity or attract certain investors, causing the performance of the stock to be different than without the split or reverse split. Wang et al (2014) build a portfolio using the 25 lowest priced stocks in the S&amp;P index based on adjusted and non-adjusted prices. The portfolio based on adjusted prices greatly outperformed the one with raw prices in terms of return and <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/key-concepts/glossary#24-Sharpe-ratio'>Sharpe ratio</a>. In this case, if you were to analyze the low price factor with adjusted prices, it would lead you to believe the factor is very informative, but it would not perform well out-of-sample with raw data.</p>

<p>Look-ahead bias can also occur if you set the universe to assets that have performed well during the backtest period or initialize indicators with values that have performed well during the backtest period. To avoid issues with look-ahead bias, trade a <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/universes/key-concepts">dynamic universe of assets</a> and use point-in-time data. If point-in-time data is not available for the dataset you use, apply a reporting lag. Since the backtesting environment is event-driven and you can't pass the time frontier, it naturally helps to reduce the risk of look-ahead bias.</p>
