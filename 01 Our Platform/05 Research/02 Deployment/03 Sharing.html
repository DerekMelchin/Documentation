<p>The Research Environment does not currently support simultaneous coding between two peers. You can view the notebook of your colleague, but you can't edit the notebook at the same time. We recommend that only one person opens a notebook because your work may not save if several people open the same notebook. To enable your team members to see your notebook, <a href="/docs/v2/our-platform/projects/collaboration#03-Add-Team-Members">add them to the project</a>.</p>

<p>Sharing your notebooks is helpful when publishing your findings online, getting feedback on your research process, and explaining your methodology to others. To share a notebook with members not in your organization, <a href="/docs/v2/our-platform/backtesting/deployment#08-Run-Backtests">run a backtest</a>, <a href="/docs/v2/our-platform/backtesting/results#14-Share-Results">generate a link to share the backtest</a>, and then give the backtest link to the other person. They will be able to clone the project and launch the Research Environment using the notebook files.</p>
