You can view all of your organization's nodes from the <a href='/docs/v2/our-platform/organizations/resources#11-View-All-Nodes'>Resources page</a> or the <a href='/docs/v2/our-platform/projects/ide#07-Manage-Nodes'>Resources panel in the IDE</a>. The Resources panel lets you select a specific research node to use.</p>
