<p>Drawdown is the largest peak to trough decline in your algorithm's equity curve. Drawdown is calculated as</p>

$$
1- \frac{v^{t\ge s}_{min}}{v^s_{max}}
$$

<p>where $v^s_{max}$ is the maximum equity value up to time $s$ and $v^{t\ge s}_{min}$ is the minimum equity value at time $t$ where $t\ge s$. The following image illustrates how the max drawdown is calculated:</p> 

<img class='img-responsive' src="https://cdn.quantconnect.com/i/tu/largest-drawdown-chart-1.png" alt="An equity curve that has the drawdown periods highlighted">
<p>During the first highlighted period in the image above, the equity curve dropped from 106,027 to 93,949 (11.4%). During the second highlighted period, the equity curve dropped from 112,848 to 99,576 (11.8%). Since 11.8% &gt; 11.4%, the max drawdown of the equity curve is 11.8%.</p>

<p>The benefit of using drawdown as the objective is that it's psychologically easier to keep an algorithm deployed in live mode if the algorithm doesn't experience large drawdowns. The drawback of using drawdown is that it may limit the potential returns of your algorithm.</p>
