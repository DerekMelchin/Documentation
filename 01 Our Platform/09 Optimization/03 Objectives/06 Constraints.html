<p>Constraints filter out backtests from your optimization results that do not conform to your desired range of statistical results. Constraints consist of a target, operator, and a numerical value. For instance, you can add a constraint that the optimization backtests must have a Sharpe ratio &gt;= 1 to be included in the optimization results. Constraints are optional, but you can use them to incorporate multiple objective functions into a single optimization job. </p>
