<p>The PSR is the probability that the estimated Sharpe ratio of your algorithm is greater than the Sharpe ratio of the benchmark. PSR is calculated as</p>

\[ P\left(\hat{SR} > SR^{\ast}\right) = CDF\left(\frac{(\hat{SR} - SR^{\ast})\sqrt{n-1}}{\sqrt{1 - \hat{\gamma}_{3}\hat{SR} + \frac{\hat{\gamma}_{4}-1}{4}\hat{SR}^{2}}}\right) \]

<p>where $SR^{\ast}$ is the Sharpe ratio of the benchmark, $\hat{SR}$ is the Sharpe ratio of your algorithm, $n$ is the number of trading days, $\hat{\gamma}_{3}$ is the skewness of your algorithm's returns, $\hat{\gamma}_{4}$ is the kurtosis of your algorithm's returns, and $CDF$ is the normal cumulative distribution function. The benefit of using the PSR as the objective is that it maximizes the probability of your algorithm's Sharpe ratio outperforming the benchmark Sharpe ratio. The drawback of using the PSR is that, like the Sharpe ratio objective, optimizing the PSR may limit your potential returns in favor of a less volatile equity curve.</p>
