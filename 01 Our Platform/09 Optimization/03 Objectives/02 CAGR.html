<p>CAGR is the yearly return that would be required to generate the return over the backtest period. CAGR is calculated as</p>

$$
(\frac{e}{s})^{\frac{1}{y}}-1
$$

<p>where $s$ is starting equity, $e$ is ending equity, and $y$ is the number of years in the backtest period. The benefit of using CAGR as the objective is that it maximizes the return of your algorithm over the entire backtest. The drawback of using CAGR is that it may cause your algorithm to have more volatile returns, which increases the difficulty of keeping your algorithm deployed in live mode.</p>
