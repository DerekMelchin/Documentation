<p>An optimization objective is the performance metric that's used to compare the backtest performance of different parameter values. The optimizer currently supports the compound annual growth rate (CAGR), drawdown, Sharpe ratio, and Probabilistic Sharpe ratio (PSR) as optimization objectives. When the optimization job finishes, the results page displays the value of the objective with respect to the parameter values.</p>
