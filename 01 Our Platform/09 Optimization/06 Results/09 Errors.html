    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Runtime Errors</td>
            <td>If a backtest in your optimization job throws a runtime error, the backtest will not complete but you will still be charged.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Data Overload</td>
            <td>If a backtest in your optimization job produces more than 700MB of data, then Lean can't upload the results and the optimization job appears to never be complete.</td>
        </tr>
