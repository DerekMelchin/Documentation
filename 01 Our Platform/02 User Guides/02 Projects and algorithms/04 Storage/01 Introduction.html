<p>QuantConnect enables you to save projects and files on our cloud servers under your QC account so you can access them from anywhere. In addition to saving projects and files, organizations can save data in the ObjectStore. The ObjectStore is a project-specific key-value storage location to save and retrieve strings and bytes. Some common use cases of the ObjectStore include the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Saving algorithm variable values between deployments.</li>
	<li>Transporting data between the backtesting environment and the research environment.</li>
	<li>Training machine learning models in the research environment before deploying them to live trading.</li>
</ul>
