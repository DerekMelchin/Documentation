<p>The ObjectStore allows you to freely store 500MB of data. To unlock more ObjectStore storage space, you need to have at least a Team organization. You can subscribe to one of the ObjectStore add-ons on the <a href="https://www.quantconnect.com/pricing">Pricing</a> page. The cost of ObjectStore storage space is $10/GB. The following storage options are available:</p>

<ul>
    <li>500MB - Free</li>
    <li>1GB - $10/month</li>
    <li>2GB - $20/month</li>
    <li>5GB - $50/month</li>
    <li>10GB - $100/month</li>
</ul>

<p>You can see how much ObjectStore storage your organization has used from the <strong>Organization > Resources</strong> page. The usage reports list the total usage in the organization and the usage of individual projects within the organization so you can easily manage your ObjectStore usage.</p>
