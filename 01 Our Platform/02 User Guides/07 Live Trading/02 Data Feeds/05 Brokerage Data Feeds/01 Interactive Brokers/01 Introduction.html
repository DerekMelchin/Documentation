<p>The Interactive Brokers (IB) data feeds are streams of Equity, Futures, and Options prices directly from IB. The data feed is a summarized snapshot of the trades and quotes at roughly 300 milliseconds per snapshot. In contrast, our data feed consolidates the trades and quotes across all of the exchanges into a real-time stream with a 50 millisecond delay. To use IB data feeds in your algorithms, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/software/cp/am/settings/marketdatasubscriptions.htm">subscribe to IB market data</a>. We support all of the IB data subscriptions that are related to <a href="/docs/v2/our-platform/user-guides/live-trading/brokerages/interactive-brokers#04-Asset-Classes">the securities and markets we support</a>. Members usually subscribe to the following IB market data:</p>

<ul>
    <li>US Securities Snapshot and Futures Value Bundle</li>
    <li>US Equity and Options Add-On Streaming Bundle</li>
</ul>

<p>If you deploy a live algorithm with the IB brokerage, you can use the QC data feed, the IB data feed, or both.</p>
