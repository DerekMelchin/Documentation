  "content" : "<p>Data feeds are a stream of security trades, quotes, corporate actions, and alternative data factors delivered to your trading algorithm during live execution. You need live data feeds to inject data into your algorithm so that you can make real-time trading decisions and so that the values of the securities in your portfolio are updated. For instance, if you're trading US Options, your position values will usually be read from your brokerage account when you deploy the algorithm, but your position values can only be updated as the algorithm progresses if you have a data feed for US Options. You can trade securities for which you don't have a data feed, but you'll receive a warning and the position value will not be updated over time.</p>",
