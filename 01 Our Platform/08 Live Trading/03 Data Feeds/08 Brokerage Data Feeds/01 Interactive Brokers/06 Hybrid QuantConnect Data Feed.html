<p>When you <a href='/docs/v2/our-platform/live-trading/brokerages/interactive-brokers#16-Deploy-Live-Algorithms'>deploy a live algorithm with the IB brokerage</a>, you can use the QC data feed, the IB data feed, or both. If you use both data feeds, Lean gives priority to the QuantConnect data feed. If our data feed doesn't have a stream for the securities you request, Lean uses the IB data feed. This process makes it possible to use our data feed for Equity universe selection and then place Options trades on the securities in the universe. If you use the QC data feed, the assets that you subscribe to don't contribute to the <a href='/docs/v2/our-platform/live-trading/data-feeds/brokerage-data-feeds/interactive-brokers#03-Universe-Selection'>IB data feed limit</a>.</p>
