<p>Automatic restarts use best efforts to restart your algorithm if it fails due to a runtime error or an API disconnection. Automatic restarts reduce the risk of your algorithm missing a trade during periods of downtime. If you enable automatic restarts when you deploy your algorithm and your algorithm fails, your algorithm will try five times to restart. After five unsuccessful restarts, your algorithm won't attempt to restart again.</p>
