<p>Members often use 8-32GB of RAM in backtesting and are concerned that their algorithms will not work in live trading since live trading nodes have 512MB to 4GB of RAM. Backtesting nodes have more RAM because data is injected into your algorithm roughly 100,000x faster during backtests than live trading. You use more RAM in backtesting because many data objects are cached to achieve such fast speed. In live trading, 512MB to 4GB of RAM is sufficient for almost all use cases.</p>
