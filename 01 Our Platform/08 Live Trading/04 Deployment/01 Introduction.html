<p>Deploy your trading algorithms live to receive real-time market data and submit orders on our co-located servers. As your algorithms run, you can view their performance in the Algorithm Lab. Since the algorithms run in QC Cloud, you can close the IDE without interrupting the execution of your algorithms. Deploying your algorithms to live trading through QuantConnect is cheaper than purchasing server space, setting up data feeds, and maintaining the software on your own. To deploy your algorithms on QuantConnect, you just need to follow the <span class='page-section-name'>Deploy Live Algorithms</span> section in the <a href='/docs/v2/our-platform/live-trading/brokerages'>guide of your brokerage</a>.</p>
