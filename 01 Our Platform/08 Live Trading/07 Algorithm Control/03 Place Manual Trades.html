<p>The live results page lets you manually place orders instead of calling the automated methods in your project files. You can use any order type that is supported by the brokerage that you used when deploying the algorithm. To view the supported order types of your brokerage, see the <span class='page-section-name'>Orders</span> section of your <a href='/docs/v2/our-platform/live-trading/brokerages'>brokerage guide</a>. Some example situations where it may be helpful to place manual orders instead of stopping and redeploying the algorithm include the following:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Your brokerage account had holdings in it before you deployed your algorithm</li>
    <li>Your algorithm had bugs in it that caused it to purchase the wrong security</li>
    <li>You want to add a hedge to your portfolio without adjusting the algorithm code</li>
    <li>You want to rebalance your portfolio before the rebalance date</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that it's not currently possible to cancel manual orders.</p>

<p>Follow these steps to place manual orders:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Open your algorithm's <a href="/docs/v2/our-platform/live-trading/results#02-View-Live-Results">live results page</a>.</li>
    <li>In the <span class="tab-name">Holdings</span> tab, if the security you want to trade isn't listed, click <span class='button-name'>Show All Portfolio</span>.</li>
    <li>If the security you want to trade still isn't listed, <a href='/docs/v2/our-platform/live-trading/algorithm-control#02-Add-Security-Subscriptions'>subscribe to the security</a>.</li>
    <li>Click the security you want to trade.</li>
    <li>Click <span class='button-name'>Create Order</span> or <span class='button-name'>Liquidate</span>.</li>
    <li>If you clicked <span class='button-name'>Create Order</span>, enter an order quantity.</li>
    <li>Click the <span class='field-name'>Type</span> field and then click an order type from the drop-down menu.</li>
    <li>Click <span class='button-name'>Submit Order</span>.</li>
</ol>
