<p>The live results page enables you to manually create security subscriptions for your algorithm instead of calling the <code>Add<span class="placeholder-text">securityType</span></code> methods in your code files. If you add security subscriptions to your algorithm, you can place manual trades through the IDE without having to edit and redeploy the algorithm. Follow these steps to add security subscriptions:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Open your algorithm's <a href="/docs/v2/our-platform/live-trading/results#02-View-Live-Results">live results page</a>.</li>
    <li>In the <span class="tab-name">Holdings</span> tab, click <span class="button-name">Add Security</span>.</li>
    <li>Enter the symbol, security type, resolution, leverage, and market of the security you want to add.</li>
    <li>If you want the data for the security to be filled-forward, check the <span class="box-name">Fill Forward</span> check box.</li>
    <li>If you want to subscribe to extended market hours for the security, check the <span class="box-name">Extended Market Hours</span> check box.</li>
    <li>Click <span class="button-name">Add Security</span>.</li>
</ol>

<p>You can't manually remove security subscriptions from the IDE.</p>
