<p>Counterparty risk is the risk that a counterparty with which you engage won't pay an obligation that they have made with you. Most commonly, counterparty risk is associated with the risk that your brokerage goes out of business without returning the trading capital that you have in your brokerage account. Brokerages can go bankrupt just like any other business. To address counterparty risk, diversify your portfolio across multiple brokers that have a strong reputation. If you allocate your capital across multiple brokers and one of them goes out of business, you won't lose all of your trading capital.</p>
