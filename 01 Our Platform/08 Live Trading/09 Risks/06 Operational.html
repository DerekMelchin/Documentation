<p>Operational risks are the risks within your fund that relate to business operations, such as business risks, regulatory risks, trading infrastructure risks, and the risks of employees committing fraud or quitting. Operational risks are a result of the nature of a trading business, having employees, and regulatory changes. To address operational risks, stay up to date on potential regulatory changes, only hire employees that have signed contracts that protect your firm, use open-source trading infrastructure that's maintained by experts (Lean), and use co-located servers so that you don't need to tend to hardware failures and internet outages. </p>
