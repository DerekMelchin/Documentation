<p>Error risk is the risk associated with errors occurring in your strategy logic or trading infrastructure. Error risks occur because bugs naturally arise in trading algorithms and the underlying engine that the algorithms use to execute. The Lean trading engine has been under constant development for over 10 years, but there are always more improvements that can be implemented. To address error risk, backtest your trading algorithm before deploying it live to test if it has coding errors, stay up to date on the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean/issues">Lean GitHub Issues</a>, and have close access to your email at all times. If your trading algorithm fails, we notify you through email. You can also enable <a href="/docs/v2/our-platform/live-trading/deployment#07-Automatic-Restarts">automatic restarts</a> when you deploy algorithms.</p>
