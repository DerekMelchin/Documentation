<p><a target='_blank' href='https://qnt.co/atreyu'>Atreyu Trading</a> was founded by George Kledaras and John Pyrovolakis in 2015 with the goal to connect quantitative managers to US markets. <a target='_blank' href='https://qnt.co/atreyu'>Atreyu Trading</a> provides access to US prime brokers for clients from all countries that are not on the FinCen Anti-Money Laundering list. In addition to market access, <a target='_blank' href='https://qnt.co/atreyu'>Atreyu Trading</a> provides information about short availability. <a target='_blank' href='https://qnt.co/atreyu'>Atreyu Trading</a> doesn't have regulatory approval to trade for retail accounts, so you need to be a high net worth ($25M+) individual or firm to open an account. You need an organization on the Trading Firm or Institution tier to use the <a target='_blank' href='https://qnt.co/atreyu'>Atreyu Trading</a> brokerage.</p>
