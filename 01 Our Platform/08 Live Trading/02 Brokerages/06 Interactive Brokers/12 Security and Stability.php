<h4>Connections</h4>
<p>By default, IB only supports one connection at a time to your account. If you interfere with your brokerage account while an algorithm is connected to it, the algorithm may stop executing. If you deploy a live running algorithm with your IB account and want to open Trader Workstation (TWS) with the same IB account, <a rel='nofollow' target="_blank" href='https://ibkr.info/node/1004'>create a second user on your IB account</a> and log in to TWS with the new user credentials. To run more than one algorithm with IB, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.interactivebrokers.com.hk/en/software/ptgstl/topics/ptgsubaccounts.htm">open an IB subaccount</a> for each additional algorithm.</p>

<h4>SMS 2FA</h4>
<p>Our IB integration doesn't support Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) via SMS. Use the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://guides.interactivebrokers.com/iphone/log_in/ibkey.htm?tocpath=IB%20Key%20Security%20Protocol%7C_____0">IB Key Security via IBKR Mobile</a> instead.</p>

<h4>System Resets</h4>
<p>If your IB account has 2FA enabled, you'll need to re-authenticate once a week. The reset schedule is available on the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/software/systemStatus.php">IB Status page</a>. If you miss the timeout period, your algorithm quits executing.</p>
