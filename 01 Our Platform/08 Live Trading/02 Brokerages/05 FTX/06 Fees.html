<p>If you add liquidity to the order book by placing a limit order that doesn't cross the spread, you pay maker fees. If you remove liquidity from the order book by placing an order that crosses the spread, you pay taker fees. You pay the fees in the base currency for maker orders and the quote currency for taker orders. FTX and FTXUS adjust your fees based on your 30-day trading volume and FTT balance, but we don't currently model these metrics to adjust fees.
