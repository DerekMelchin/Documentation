<p>To free up storage space, delete the key-value pairs stored in the ObjectStore or <a href='/docs/v2/our-platform/projects/getting-started#11-Delete-Projects'>delete projects</a> that have data in the ObjectStore.</p>

<p>To delete a key-value pair stored in the ObjectStore, call the <code>Delete</code> method with a key.</p>
<div class="section-example-container">
    <pre class="csharp">ObjectStore.Delete(key);</pre>
    <pre class="python">self.ObjectStore.Delete(key)</pre>
</div>

<p>To keep your code while also deleting projects, <a href='/docs/v2/our-platform/projects/collaboration#04-Other-Collaboration-Methods'>clone the project</a> and then delete the original project.</p>
