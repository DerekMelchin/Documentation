<p>New projects contains code files (<span class="public-file-name">.py</span> or <span class="public-file-name">.cs</span>) and notebook files (<span class="public-file-name">.ipynb</span>). Run backtests with code files and launch the Research Environment with notebook files. Code files can contain up to 64,000 characters and notebook files can be up to 128KB in size. To keep files small, files can import code from other code files.
