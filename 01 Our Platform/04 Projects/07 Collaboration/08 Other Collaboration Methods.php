<p>Additional methods of collaboration include cloning, sharing, and migrating projects.</p>

<h4>Clone Projects</h4>
<?php echo file_get_contents(DOCS_RESOURCES."/ide/clone-projects.html"); ?>
<p>To clone projects, <a href="/docs/v2/our-platform/projects/getting-started#02-View-All-Projects">open the project</a> you want to clone and then, in the Project panel, click <span class="button-name">Clone</span>. "Project cloned successfully" displays.</p>

<h4>Share Projects</h4>
<p><a href="/docs/v2/our-platform/backtesting/deployment#08-Run-Backtests">Run a backtest</a> and then <a href="/docs/v2/our-platform/backtesting/results#14-Share-Results">make the backtest results public</a> to share a project. Once a backtest is made public, a link is generated for you that opens the backtest results and the project files. You can directly give the link to others, attach the backtest to a forum discussion, or embed the backtest into a website. However, note that when you make a backtest public, the project files are accessible to anyone who visits the link, even after you delete the project. As a result, we don't recommend collaborating on projects by making backtests public and sharing the link with your collaborators. Instead, add team members to your project since it protects your intellectual property.</p>

<p>You can share a backtest at any time when it's executing. Although, if you generate a link to share the backtest before the backtest completes, the link that's generated will not contain all of the backtest results. Some reasons to share your project include the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Attach the project to the forum to ask for help, gather feedback, or report an issue.</li>
    <li>Attach the project to a data issue to reduce the amount of time it takes to fix the data issue.</li>
    <li>Share a link to the project with others to give them a copy of the project files and the backtest results.</li>
</ul>

<p>To share a research notebook, save the notebook and run a backtest.</p>

<h4>Migrate Projects</h4>
<?php echo file_get_contents(DOCS_RESOURCES."/ide/migrate-projects.html"); ?>

<p>Follow these steps to migrate projects:</p>
<ol>
    <li><a href="/docs/v2/our-platform/projects/getting-started#02-View-All-Projects">Open the project</a> you want to migrate.</li>
    <li>In the Project panel, click <span class="button-name">Migrate</span>.</li>
    <li>Click the name of the organization to which you want to migrate the project and then click <span class="button-name">Migrate</span>.</li>
    <p>The top navigation bar displays <span class="button-name">Connected as: <span class="placeholder-text">theOrganizationYouMigratedTo</span></span>.</p>
</ol>
