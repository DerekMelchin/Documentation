<p>If you have the <a href="/docs/v2/our-platform/community/profile#03-Code-Settings">Automatic Builds setting</a> enabled, your projects will automatically build after each keystroke. To manually build a project, <a href="/docs/v2/our-platform/projects/project-management#02-View-All-Projects">open the project</a> and then click the <img class='inline-icon' src="https://cdn.quantconnect.com/i/tu/build-button.png"> <span class="button-name">Build</span> icon. If the build process is unresponsive, try refreshing the page and building again. If the build process continues to be unresponsive, check our <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://status.quantconnect.com/">Status page</a> or <a href="/contact">contact us</a>. If the compiler finds errors during the build process, the IDE highlights the lines of code that caused the errors.</p>
