<p>A set of benchmark algorithms are periodically run to test the status and speed of the Lean master branch. View the <a href="/performance">Lean Performance Benchmark</a> page to see the results. The chart at the top of the page shows the data points per second for each of the benchmark algorithms. The table at the bottom of the page shows the benchmark algorithms that are run to produce the results.</p>
