<p>The Institution tier builds on the features included in the Trading Firm tier. Organizations on the Institution tier have no limit on the amount of backtest logs that they can produce and each member in the organization can have up to 16 active coding sessions. These organizations can subscribe to the <a href="/docs/v2/our-platform/live-trading/brokerages/prime-brokerages">Terminal Link</a> CLI add-on to live trade Equities, Futures, and Options via the Bloomberg ESMX. They can also request <a href="/docs/v2/our-platform/projects/libraries/custom-libraries">custom libraries and frameworks</a> to use in the QuantConnect web IDE and receive instant messaging support from a QuantConnect engineer. <br></p>
