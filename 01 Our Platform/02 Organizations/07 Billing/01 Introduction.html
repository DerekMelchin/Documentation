<p>The owner of an organization is responsible for the billing, but the responsibility can be delegated in Trading Firm or Institution organizations. Your organization's billing information is never saved by QuantConnect. Itâ€™s passed to the Stripe billing system. If you cancel your subscription, your live trading nodes stop running. So, for user safety, your subscriptions automatically renew each month.</p>
