<p>Organizations can subscribe to hardware resources to run backtests, launch research notebooks, and deploy live trading algorithms to co-located servers. Organizations also have access to storage resources via the ObjectStore to store data between backtests or live trading deployments. To promote efficiency, all of these resources within your organization are shared among all of the members within the organization. A team of several quants can all share one backtest, research, and live trading node.</p>
