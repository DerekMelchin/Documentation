<p>Backtesting nodes enable you to run backtests. The more backtesting nodes your organization has, the more concurrent backtests that you can run. Several models of backtesting nodes are available.

The following table shows the specifications of the backtesting node models:<br></p>

This node incurs a 20-second delay when you launch backtests, but the delay is removed and the node is replaced when you subscribe to a new backtesting node in the organization. Backtesting nodes are offered on a fair usage basis and can't be used for <a href='/docs/v2/our-platform/optimization'>optimization</a>.</p>
