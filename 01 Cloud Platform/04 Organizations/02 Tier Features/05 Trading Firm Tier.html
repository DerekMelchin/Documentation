<p>The Trading Firm tier is designed for growing quantitative firms, prop desks, hedge funds, ETF companies, professional teams of quants, and sophisticated independent investors. It has special features for collaborating with consultants to protect the investor IP. If you are a company on QuantConnect, we recommend the Trading Firm Pack to make the most of QuantConnect.</p>

<p>The Trading Firm tier builds on the features included in the Team tier. Organizations on the Trading Firm tier can have an unlimited number of members and an unlimited number of collaborators simultaneously working on individual projects. The IP ownership of all the projects in these organizations remains within the organization. There is no limit on the number of backtesting, research, and live trading nodes these organizations can rent. They can produce 5MB of logs/backtest and 50MB of logs/day. Members in these organizations can have up to eight active coding sessions in the organization. </p>

<p>The owner of a Trading Firm organization can grant various <a href="/docs/v2/cloud-platform/organizations/members#08-Permissions">permissions</a> to the organizationâ€™s members, including designating a member to manage the organization's billing. These organizations have access to custom lean builds, so they can use feature branches or historical master branches to run their strategies. An example of this could be granting only a few members of your team live trading deployment access. </p>

<p>In addition to the brokerages and data feeds available to Team organizations, Trading Firm organizations can use <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/trading-and-orders/financial-advisors">Interactive Brokers Financial Advisor accounts </a>to manage sub-accounts for clients.</p>
