<p>The Academic Grant program gives researchers publishing a paper up to a three-month subscription. With this grant, you can implement your strategy and generate public source code that anyone can use to reproduce your results with our open-source platform on a uniform dataset. You can use the grant to create a <a href='/docs/v2/cloud-platform/organizations/tier-features#04-Team-Tier'>Team organization</a> with multiple members <a href='/docs/v2/cloud-platform/projects/collaboration'>collaborating</a> on the research.</p>
