<p>To get your research onto the Research page, it must respect by the following guidelines:</p>

<ol>
	<li>The research is based on some financial concept, theory, or model. It’s not just a strategy of some technical indicators and overfit parameters.</li>

	<li>The attached backtest or notebook is concise and contains plenty of comments.</li>

	<li>If the code is Python, it follows the <a href='https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>PEP8 style guide</a>.</li>

	<li>The text is well-written English without grammar or spelling errors.</li>

	<li>The text can't be generated by an LLM like ChatGPT.</li>

	<li>In-line code snippets (not code blocks) are in bold face.</li>

	<li>If there are math symbols throughout the text, it uses LateX syntax (for example, <code>\(x\)</code>).</li>

	<li>Asset class names are capitalized (for example, “Equity”).</li>

	<li>The content has the following "Heading 1" sections:</li>

	<ol>
		<li><span class='page-section-name'>Introduction</span>: This section summarizes your area of research. Explain what type of strategy it is, the universe and asset classes it’s applied to, the datasets it requires, and summarize results you found. If the strategy is based on a research paper, reference the paper at the end of the introduction.</li>

		<li><span class='page-section-name'>Background</span>: This section provides background information on foundational concepts of the strategy, utilizing LateX syntax when necessary. For example, if the strategy creates low beta portfolios, this section should define what beta is and how it’s calculated. By the end of the Background section, readers should understand what the entire strategy is, the universe it’s applied to, the factors it uses, and the portfolio construction technique.</li>

		<li><span class='page-section-name'>Implementation</span>: This section walks the reader through how to implement the strategy in LEAN. Explain each step in text and then include a short code snippet. When appropriate, link the content to relevant pages of the <a href='/docs/v2'>QuantConnect documentation</a> so readers can learn more.</li>

		<li><span class='page-section-name'>Results</span>: This section describes the backtest period, notes the Sharpe ratio, and explains if the strategy underperformed or outperformed the underlying benchmark. One of the paragraphs should analyze the parameter sensitivity and feature a screenshot of <a href='/docs/v2/cloud-platform/optimization/results#05-Parameter-Charts'>the Sharpe ratio heatmap from the optimization results page</a>. End this section by discussing the results and some areas of further research.</li>

		<li><span class='qualifier'>(Optional)</span> <span class='page-section-name'>References</span>: This section is a list of references in APA style to any source material like research papers. For more information on the APA style of reference lists, see <a href='https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/references/basic-principles' rel='nofollow' target='_blank'>Basic Principles of Reference List Entries</a> on the APA Style website.</li>
