    Quant League Pro is a quarterly competition that strives to connect quant traders who have live real-money track records with third-party institutional funds that are looking to allocate to trading strategies. Authors perform research and submit algorithms to the competition. 
    The quarterly performance of all strategies in the competition is publicly available for Funds. 
    When a Fund allocates to a strategy, the Fund creates a Separately Managed Account (SMA) through their brokerage and provides the credentials to the strategy Author. 
    The Author then <a href='https://www.quantconnect.com/docs/v2/cloud-platform/live-trading/deployment'>deploys the algorithm on QuantConnect Cloud</a> with the SMA credentials and <a href='https://www.quantconnect.com/docs/v2/cloud-platform/live-trading/algorithm-control'>manages the deployment</a> by placing manual trades and updating the algorithm when necessary.

    The strategies competing in Quant League Pro run with real money from the strategy Author. 
    In addition to the returns they generate by running their own strategy and the earnings from their allocation agreement with the Fund, Authors can earn quarterly prizes if their strategies rank near the top of the leaderboard.
