<p>If you have unsupported assets in your brokerage account when you deploy, Lean can't calculate the portfolio value correctly, so margin calculations are wrong. To avoid issues, if your account has unsupported assets, Lean automatically exits on deployment. For a list of supported assets, see the asset class <a href='/datasets'>dataset listing</a>.</p>
