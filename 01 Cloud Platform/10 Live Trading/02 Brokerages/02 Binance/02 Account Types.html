<p>Binance supports cash and margin accounts for spot trades, but only supports margin accounts for Futures trades. Binance US only supports cash accounts. To set the account type in an algorithm, see the <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/reality-modeling/brokerages/supported-models/binance'>Binance brokerage model documentation</a>.</p>


<h4>Create an Account</h4>
<p>Follow the account creation wizard on the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://accounts.binance.com/en/register">Binance.com</a> or <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://accounts.binance.us/en/register">Binance.us</a> website to create a Binance account.</p>

After you open your account, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/360002502072">create API credentials</a> and store them somewhere safe. As you create credentials, set the IP access restrictions to <span class="box-name">Unrestricted</span> and, if you are going to trade Crypto Futures, select the <span class="box-name">Enable Futures</span> check box.</p>
