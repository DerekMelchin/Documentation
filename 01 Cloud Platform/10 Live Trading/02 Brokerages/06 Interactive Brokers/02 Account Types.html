<p>The IB API does not support the IBKR LITE plan. You need an IBKR PRO plan. Individual and Financial Advisor (FA) accounts are available.</p>

<h4>Individual Accounts</h4>
<p>IB supports cash and margin accounts. To set the account type in an algorithm, see the <a href='/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/reality-modeling/brokerages/supported-models/interactive-brokers'>IB brokerage model documentation</a>.</p>

<h4>FA Accounts</h4>
<p>IB supports FA accounts for Trading Firm and Institution organizations. FA accounts enable certified professionals to use a single trading algorithm to manage several client accounts. For more information about FA accounts, see <a href="/docs/v2/writing-algorithms/trading-and-orders/financial-advisors">Financial Advisors</a>.</p>

<h4>Create an Account</h4>
<p>You need to open an IBKR Pro account to deploy algorithms with IB. The IB API does not support IBKR Lite accounts. To create an IB account, see the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://gdcdyn.interactivebrokers.com/en/index.php?f=4695">Open an Account</a> page on the IB website.</p>

<p>You need to activate IBKR Mobile Authentication (IB Key) to deploy live algorithms with your brokerage account. After you open your account, follow the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://ibkr.info/node/2260">installation and activation instructions</a> on the IB website.</p>

<h4>Paper Trading</h4>
<p>IB supports paper trading. Follow the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/software/ptgstl/topics/papertrader.htm">Opening a Paper Trading Account</a> page in the IB documentation to set up your paper trading account.</p>

<p>If you want to use <a href="/docs/v2/cloud-platform/live-trading/data-feeds/brokerage-data-feeds/interactive-brokers">IB data feeds</a> and trade with your paper trading account, follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Log in to the IB Client Portal.</li>
    <li>In the top-right corner, click the <span class="icon-name">person</span> icon and then click <span class="menu-name">Settings</span>.</li>
    <li>In the <span class="page-section-name">Account Configuration</span> section, click <span class="page-section-name">Paper Trading Account</span>.</li>
    <li>Click <span class="button-name">Yes</span>.</li>
    <li>Click <span class="button-name">Save</span>.</li>
</ol>

<p>The IB paper trading environment simulates most aspects of a production Trader Workstation account, but you may encounter some differences due to its construction as a simulator with no execution or clearing abilities.</p>
